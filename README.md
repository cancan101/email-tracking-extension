# Chrome Extension for Email Tracking

Bootstrapped using: https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react

## Installing and Running

### Procedures:

1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is >= **14**.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start`
4. Load your extension on Chrome following:
   1. Access `chrome://extensions/`
   2. Check `Developer mode`
   3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   4. Select the `build` folder.

## Webpack auto-reload and HRM

To make your workflow much more efficient this boilerplate uses the [webpack server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) to development (started with `npm start`) with auto reload feature that reloads the browser automatically every time that you save some file in your editor.

You can run the dev mode on other port if you want. Just specify the env var `port` like this:

```
$ PORT=6002 npm run start
```

## Packing

After the development of your extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.

## Secrets

If you are developing an extension that talks with some API you probably are using different keys for testing and production. Is a good practice you not commit your secret keys and expose to anyone that have access to the repository.

To this task this boilerplate import the file `./secrets.<THE-NODE_ENV>.js` on your modules through the module named as `secrets`, so you can do things like this:

_./secrets.development.js_

```js
export default { key: '123' };
```

_./src/popup.js_

```js
import secrets from 'secrets';
ApiCall({ key: secrets.key });
```

:point_right: The files with name `secrets.*.js` already are ignored on the repository.
